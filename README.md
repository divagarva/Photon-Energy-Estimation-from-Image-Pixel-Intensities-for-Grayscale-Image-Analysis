# Photon-Energy-Estimation-from-Image-Pixel-Intensities-for-Grayscale-Image-Analysis
 This project explores photon energy estimation from grayscale image pixel intensities, converting pixel values into corresponding wavelengths within the visible light spectrum. Using Planckâ€™s equation, photon energy is calculated for each pixel, and visualized through heatmaps, histograms, and 3D plots.
